# 🚕 Urban Routes - Test Design & Analysis

## 📝 About the Project

In this second stage of the Urban Routes project, the focus shifted from simple execution to Test Design. I learned how to analyze requirements deeply to create structured documentation that ensures every corner of the "Reserve a Taxi" feature is tested.

## 🎯 What I Learned & Applied

- Test Case Design: How to write professional test cases with clear steps and specific expected results.
- Checklist Creation: Organizing high-level scenarios to ensure full feature coverage.
- Error Prevention: Avoiding common pitfalls in technical writing, such as ambiguity or missing preconditions.
- Visual Analysis: Using Mind Maps and Flowcharts to understand complex user journeys before writing a single test.

## 📊 Visual Documentation

Before writing the tests, I mapped the application logic to ensure no scenario was left behind.

 **Mind Map (Feature Breakdown)**

## 🛠 Tools & Deliverables

- Google Sheets: For the Test Case Suite and the Requirement Checklist.
- Miro/Lucidchart (or your tool): To design the Mind Map and Flowchart.
- Chrome DevTools: To validate technical requirements.

## 💡 Key Results

- Designed a complete suite of Test Cases covering the taxi booking flow.
- Identified and avoided logic gaps by using visual diagrams before execution.
- Improved the clarity of bug reporting by mastering professional technical writing.

## 🌍 Language Notice
[!NOTE] Documentation Language All technical documentation (Test Cases, Checklist, and Diagrams) was created in Spanish to meet the project's original requirements. This README provides an English summary for international viewers.
